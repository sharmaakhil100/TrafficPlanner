# Traffic-Optimized Trip Planner

A smart day trip planner that optimizes your route based on real-time and historical traffic data using Google Maps API. The application helps users plan their day trips by suggesting the optimal order of visits to minimize time spent in traffic.

### Components

1. **Frontend**
   - Modern, responsive UI built with HTML5, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS
   - Interactive Google Maps integration
   - Real-time location search with autocomplete
   - Dynamic route visualization
   - Traffic condition indicators

2. **Backend**
   - Flask server handling route optimization
   - Google Maps API integration for:
     - Geocoding
     - Distance Matrix calculations
     - Traffic data
     - Route optimization

3. **External Services**
   - Google Maps JavaScript API
   - Google Maps Directions API
   - Google Places API for location autocomplete

### Algorithm

The route optimization algorithm uses a combination of techniques:

1. **Traffic Data Collection**
   - Checks traffic conditions at multiple times (9 AM, 12 PM, 3 PM, 5 PM, 7 PM)
   - Uses Google's historical traffic data via `traffic_model='best_guess'`
   - Creates a duration matrix for each time slot

2. **Route Optimization**
   - Implements a modified greedy algorithm that:
     - Starts from the user's current location
     - Considers both morning (9 AM) and evening (5 PM) start times
     - Minimizes total travel time including traffic delays
     - Accounts for time-dependent traffic patterns

3. **Decision Making**
   ```python
   for each start_time in [morning, evening]:
       current_location = starting_point
       while unvisited_locations exist:
           next_location = find_minimum_traffic_time(
               current_location,
               unvisited_locations,
               time_of_day
           )
           add_to_route(next_location)
   ```

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up your Google Maps API key:
   - Get an API key from Google Cloud Console
   - Enable the following APIs:
     - Maps JavaScript API
     - Directions API
     - Places API
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:
     ```
     GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

5. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

## Features

## Technical Details

### Traffic Data Analysis
The system analyzes traffic patterns by:
1. Collecting traffic data for multiple time slots
2. Computing duration matrices for each time slot
3. Comparing normal duration vs. traffic-affected duration
4. Identifying heavy traffic conditions

### Route Optimization Logic
```python
# Pseudocode for core optimization
for each time_slot:
    duration_matrix = []
    for origin in locations:
        for destination in locations:
            duration = get_traffic_duration(
                origin,
                destination,
                time_slot
            )
            duration_matrix[origin][destination] = duration
    
    optimized_route = []
    current = start_location
    while unvisited_locations:
        next = min(
            unvisited_locations,
            key=lambda x: duration_matrix[current][x]
        )
        optimized_route.append(next)
        current = next
```

## Future Enhancements

1. Multi-day trip planning
2. Weather data integration
3. Public transportation options
4. Location operating hours consideration
5. Break time suggestions
6. Route sharing capabilities
7. Multiple route alternatives
8. Traffic prediction modeling
